Habits

Today, I will try to deepen my understanding of habits.
Broadly speaking, there are two types: bad habits and good habits.
What are good habits?
Waking up early, striving for healthy eating, avoiding social media... Anything that you "know is good but can't continue doing" is acceptable.
On the other hand, what are bad habits?
Staying up late, indulging in excessive eating and drinking, smoking, feeling down after watching unpleasant news... Anything that you "want to quit but can't" is acceptable.
Don't you find it strange when comparing these two? It's better to continue good habits and quit bad habits.
We should know this, yet we never seem to change.
I'm the same as you. I can't stop eating high-calorie delicious food, I keep putting off things I should do, and I end up stressed and frustrated about personal matters.
However, I always remind myself not to blame the environment or others.
Initially, the people close to you will listen to your worries and try to affirm you.
They will encourage you and say, "It's for your own good." There might also be people who scold you.
Getting emotional at that moment will hurt the people who trust you.
You may feel like a victim, but if you hurt those around you with your aggressive attitude, you become the perpetrator.
In the first place, if you keep blaming others, you will never be able to change.
Whether it's a good habit or a bad habit, ultimately, who decided to make it a habit?
That's right, it's you yourself.
You're the one suffering from the decisions you made.
Don't you find it foolish?
Arguing back, "I already know that," is the most pointless thing in life.
How many times have you said those words to yourself?
If you know it, why does it keep being said to you?
Just admit that you don't understand and start from scratch.
If you start from here, a better version of yourself will be waiting for you tomorrow than today.
It has only been a few days since I adopted this mindset, but I reflect on each day to make it stick, and I am gradually changing.
Let's work hard together to become someone we can love!
